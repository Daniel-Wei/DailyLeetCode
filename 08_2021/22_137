# 137. Single Number II

** Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find the single element and return it.

** You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

# Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3

# Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99

class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        counter = {}
        for num in nums:
            if num not in counter:
                counter[num] = 1
            else:
                counter[num] += 1
        for k in counter.keys():
            if counter[k] == 1:
                return k
