# 996. Number of Squareful Arrays

*** Given an array nums of non-negative integers, 
    the array is squareful if for every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.

*** Return the number of permutations of nums that are squareful. 
    Two permutations perm1 and perm2 differ if and only if there is some index i such that perm1[i] != perm2[i].

import collections

    def numSquarefulPerms(self, nums):
        count = collections.Counter(nums)

        for x in count:  # Find those numbers and x can form a square
            for y in count:
                if int((x+y)**.5 + 0.5) ** 2 == x+y:  # ,0.5 plus and without adding does not affect the result
                    graph[x].append(y)

        def dfs(x, todo):
            count[x] -= 1

                ans = 1
            else:
                ans = 0
                for y in graph[x]:  # Select a number in turn for depth-first recursive judgment
                    if count[y]:
                        ans += dfs(y, todo - 1)
            count[x] += 1
            return ans

        return sum(dfs(x, len(nums) - 1) for x in count)
